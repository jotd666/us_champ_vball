Instructions:

5: insert coin
1/2: start game
arrows/joystick: move
red/ctrl: hit ball
blue/alt: jump/increase spike power

How to play:

Serve: either just push "hit" then "hit" again for normal serve (takes more time, can be countered by good opponents)
or choose a jumping serve. Push "hit", "jump", then "hit" again for a more powerful & fast serve. I think left/right
controls the strength of the serve too.

Defence: jump in front of spike attacks. The player you control gets a "1P" or "2P" flashing sign over him.

Attack: receive ball, the CPU helps and makes a pass, then jump (jump several times to increase power) and hit to spike.
If you miss, you can still bounce back the ball to the other side. I think (not sure) that changing directions while
hitting the ball allows to control it more.

Spike red power can stun the player who tried to receive it. Time the spikes properly to get better chance of opponents not
succeeding into sending it back or attacking. If the opponent gets stunned, it is possible that the other opponent player
sends the ball without attacking. You can attack again, but you lose time.
