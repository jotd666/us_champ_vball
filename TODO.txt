- IRQ: irq_eea4 each 15 lines (on 288 lines) using copper int: now locks up???
- then test insert coin!!: locks up:
- sprite update crashing randomly (anyway: not correct)

- X scrolling doesn't work properly
- display sprites properly
- reduce global colors, reduce tile colors
- more accurate irq period (do irqs after pal wait if possible, at least 1 should be possible!)

- convert_graphics: separate tile/sprite files but computed together, separate palette file

- create one gfx set per level/context like Dragonninja based on palette setup
  hopefully it's enough


- should detect bank1 in jsr fffxx if fffxx is logged!!

  
- implement scrollx with OCS setup ATM (scroll table = 16): doesn't work
- DB16: write blank char doesn't work in 2BA9: debug

- fmode=3!! bplmod, ddfstop, pal copperlist & scroll table



- cli/sei: interruptions not enabled
- better bank switching if too frequent
