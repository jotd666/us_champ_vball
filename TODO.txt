minor:

- when hitting net, sprite default red flash occurs but dump reveals no new sprites
- sometimes starts with 10+ credits!!
- maybe not include some unused sounds to save memory? (yaah_31?)

optims:

- do a EHB version for ECS
- 32/64 colors: identify colors used only on top of tiles: create an array with "palette entry => min/max y" for each color of the background
  simpler: find a zone where color 1 & 2 isn't used at all (scrolling !!!)
  problem: if tile replaced colors matches a sprite color after quantization, it will destroy sprite color... Complex, almost coded
  but would save 10 colors (before quantization) so forget it
- more horizontal grouping (x3/x4) marginal gain as not often displayed
- optimize bob erase/redraw at least for referee and score sprites (not trivial as the position of the sprites
  change with Y priority)
- level 1 then map context: make a kludge to avoid having to reload level 1 tiles+sprites after map
  we can probably load map with level 1 tiles+sprites loaded but that won't work for higher levels
  so maybe create a context only for "select player" screen (with only a few tiles/sprites) and make a
  special case using screen type variable on top of palette value
- big score sprites (only when no blitter chain) shifted bitplane effect on bottom probably because mirror plane with cpu while blitting it!

debug bankswitch change on MAME (22D is the copy in readable memory):
doesn't work as 22D is sometimes updated BEFORE bankswitch

wpset 1009,1,W,wpdata!=b@22D

* eaff writes 60 continuously, not interesting:

wpset 1009,1,W,pc!=$eaff

fix random (so demo does exactly the same each time!):

bpset D00A,,{A=0;PC=AFFE;g}

log sound:

wpset 100D,1,W,,{print A;g}

stop music:

bpset d7e7,A<0X15,{PC=$D7EA;g}

capture sound: remove demo sounds from dsw

bpset f7a3,,{A=$xx;g}
