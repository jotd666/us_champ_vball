- hawaii/aircftact: X scrolling doesnt work on map
- DB16: write blank char doesn't work in 2BA9: debug: comes and goes, super annoying
- missing black on level 1 (referee trunk, poles)
- level 2 transparent issue
- level 3 to dump (los angeles)
- ungroup sand sprites
- remove static sprites that hide scenery (not in japan version: NY & LA)
- keep ripping levels sprites
- after winning major league seems that there's no context probably air base has the same palette?

- reduce global colors, reduce tile colors, (32 colors on ECS!)
- better bank switching: use A5 for bank base to get more speed
- release mode: no backgrounds
- still some frames that appear missing (red) when all frames have been registered <=== ******
- fmode=3!! bplmod, ddfstop, pal copperlist & scroll table
  - rip sounds

- check sand field colors, maybe replace by attached sprites if allows to save a lot of colors.
  => field is huge (> 256 pixels) and uses only 8 colors, probably not worth it.
- identify colors used only on top of tiles: create an array with "palette entry => min/max y" for each color of the background


- still missing some black pixels (big score sprites) why????

optims

- cheat: set 9-0
- cheat: level select
- special cases for some sprites (referee, net, scores) to avoid mirroring and save chipmem
- 50Hz option

- level 1 then map context: make a kludge to avoid having to reload level 1 tiles+sprites after map
  we can probably load map with level 1 tiles+sprites loaded but that won't work for higher levels
  so maybe create a context only for "select player" screen (with only a few tiles/sprites) and make a
  special case using screen type variable on top of palette value

converter:
- if SBC_IMM	0x00 found later, don't optimize sbc into sub!
- flag manipulation can sometimes just use ANDI/ORI/EORI CCR to be faster!
- addx: set Z flag before
- sbcd/abcd warning: check bpl flag afterwards, change to bcc
- alternating OP_W_ON_ZP_ADDRESS and OP_R_ON_ZP_ADDRESS: remove PUSH/POP SR
- add or addx + addq + addx without jmp/jra/rts/CLR_XC_FLAGS/lsr/lsl/asr/asl/ror/rol => error



- more accurate irq period (do irqs after pal wait if possible, at least 1 should be possible!)

debug bankswitch change on MAME (22D is the copy in readable memory):
doesn't work as 22D is sometimes updated BEFORE bankswitch

wpset 1009,1,W,wpdata!=b@22D

* eaff writes 60 continuously, not interesting:

wpset 1009,1,W,pc!=$eaff

fix random (demo does exactly the same each time!):

bpset D00A,,{A=0;PC=AFFE;g}

log sound:

wpset 100D,1,W,,{print A,g}
