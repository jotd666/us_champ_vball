- demo: TX vs TX: no shadow under blond player (either side!), ok for the player with green trunks
- ball Y computation probably wrong when going out of screen, debug with MAME
- when clipped sprite, erase doesn't work

- still missing some black pixels (big score sprites) why????
- check if P1/P2 controls are properly read (at $FF) in the game 

- group sprites horizontally too
- select screen: no timer, game starts immediately!
- after game starts, context is loaded but no game map, no level 1 background

- converter:  if SBC_IMM	0x00 found later, don't optimize sbc into sub!
- converter:  flag manipulation can sometimes just use ANDI/ORI/EORI CCR to be faster!
- converter: addx: set Z flag before
- converter: sbcd/abcd warning: check bpl flag afterwards, change to bcc

- alternating OP_W_ON_ZP_ADDRESS and OP_R_ON_ZP_ADDRESS: remove PUSH/POP SR

- rip sounds

- 25Hz by default

- add controls to be able to play to level 1

- reduce global colors, reduce tile colors
- more accurate irq period (do irqs after pal wait if possible, at least 1 should be possible!)

- convert_graphics: separate tile/sprite files but computed together, separate palette file
- convert_graphics: group horizontally if possible for better performance, maybe using
  hardware sprites would be possible for players? difficult given the angle


- create one gfx set per level/context like Dragonninja based on palette setup
  hopefully it's enough


- DB16: write blank char doesn't work in 2BA9: debug: comes and goes, super annoying

- fmode=3!! bplmod, ddfstop, pal copperlist & scroll table

- cheat: level select

- better bank switching if too frequent (no copy, special GET_BANK_ADDRESS macro)

debug bankswitch change on MAME (22D is the copy in readable memory):
doesn't work as 22D is sometimes updated BEFORE bankswitch

wpset 1009,1,W,wpdata!=b@22D

* eaff writes 60 continuously, not interesting:

wpset 1009,1,W,pc!=$eaff

fix random (demo does exactly the same each time!):

bpset D00A,,{A=0;PC=AFFE;g}

log sound:

wpset 100D,1,W,,{print A,g}
