- there's a small y scroll during game (not during demo!!) so we have to take scrolling into account... grrrr
- reduce global colors, reduce tile colors, (32 colors on ECS!)
- better bank switching: use A5 for bank base to get more speed
- release mode: no backgrounds
- still some frames that appear missing (red) when all frames have been registered
- fmode=3!! bplmod, ddfstop, pal copperlist & scroll table
  
  
- if net doesn't move, maybe blit it in one big blit



- cheat: level select
- DB16: write blank char doesn't work in 2BA9: debug: comes and goes, super annoying
- special cases for some sprites (referee, net, scores) to avoid mirroring and save chipmem
- 50Hz option

- rip sounds

- still missing some black pixels (big score sprites) why????

converter:
- if SBC_IMM	0x00 found later, don't optimize sbc into sub!
- flag manipulation can sometimes just use ANDI/ORI/EORI CCR to be faster!
- addx: set Z flag before
- sbcd/abcd warning: check bpl flag afterwards, change to bcc
- alternating OP_W_ON_ZP_ADDRESS and OP_R_ON_ZP_ADDRESS: remove PUSH/POP SR
- add or addx + addq + addx without jmp/jra/rts/CLR_XC_FLAGS/lsr/lsl/asr/asl/ror/rol => error



- more accurate irq period (do irqs after pal wait if possible, at least 1 should be possible!)

start log regs: f519

debug bankswitch change on MAME (22D is the copy in readable memory):
doesn't work as 22D is sometimes updated BEFORE bankswitch

wpset 1009,1,W,wpdata!=b@22D

* eaff writes 60 continuously, not interesting:

wpset 1009,1,W,pc!=$eaff

fix random (demo does exactly the same each time!):

bpset D00A,,{A=0;PC=AFFE;g}

log sound:

wpset 100D,1,W,,{print A,g}
