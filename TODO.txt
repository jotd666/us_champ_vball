- debug sprites using player select screen

- sprite update crashing randomly (anyway: not correct)

- X scrolling doesn't work properly
- reduce global colors, reduce tile colors
- more accurate irq period (do irqs after pal wait if possible, at least 1 should be possible!)

- convert_graphics: separate tile/sprite files but computed together, separate palette file

- create one gfx set per level/context like Dragonninja based on palette setup
  hopefully it's enough


- implement scrollx with OCS setup ATM (scroll table = 16): doesn't work
- DB16: write blank char doesn't work in 2BA9: debug

- fmode=3!! bplmod, ddfstop, pal copperlist & scroll table



- cli/sei: interruptions not enabled
- better bank switching if too frequent

debug bankswitch change on MAME (22D is the copy in readable memory):
doesn't work as 22D is sometimes updated BEFORE bankswitch
