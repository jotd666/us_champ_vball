- better bank switching: in progress, now do the address switch instead of copying! (no copy, special GET_BANK_ADDRESS macro)
  start log regs: f519

  
- still missing some black pixels (big score sprites) why????
- check if P1/P2 controls are properly read (at $FF) in the game 

- add controls to be able to play to level 1

- select screen: no timer, game starts immediately! bank palette debug  break doesn't appear!
- after game starts, context is loaded but no game map, no level 1 background  *************
- reduce global colors, reduce tile colors
- cheat: level select
- fmode=3!! bplmod, ddfstop, pal copperlist & scroll table
- DB16: write blank char doesn't work in 2BA9: debug: comes and goes, super annoying

- 25Hz by default

- rip sounds


converter:
- if SBC_IMM	0x00 found later, don't optimize sbc into sub!
- flag manipulation can sometimes just use ANDI/ORI/EORI CCR to be faster!
- addx: set Z flag before
- sbcd/abcd warning: check bpl flag afterwards, change to bcc
- alternating OP_W_ON_ZP_ADDRESS and OP_R_ON_ZP_ADDRESS: remove PUSH/POP SR
- add or addx + addq + addx without jmp/jra/rts/CLR_XC_FLAGS/lsr/lsl/asr/asl/ror/rol => error



- more accurate irq period (do irqs after pal wait if possible, at least 1 should be possible!)


debug bankswitch change on MAME (22D is the copy in readable memory):
doesn't work as 22D is sometimes updated BEFORE bankswitch

wpset 1009,1,W,wpdata!=b@22D

* eaff writes 60 continuously, not interesting:

wpset 1009,1,W,pc!=$eaff

fix random (demo does exactly the same each time!):

bpset D00A,,{A=0;PC=AFFE;g}

log sound:

wpset 100D,1,W,,{print A,g}
