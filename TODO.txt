- convert_graphics: separate tile/sprite files but computed together, separate palette file

- create one gfx set per level/context like Dragonninja based on palette setup
  hopefully it's enough

- X scrolling doesn't work properly
- log and then display sprites

- should detect bank1 in jsr fffxx if fffxx is logged!!

- detect screen switches (color prom switch) and create as many graphics data files for tiles
  as there are proms, like BadDudes. Include sprites.
  
- implement scrollx with OCS setup ATM (scroll table = 16): doesn't work
- DB16: write blank char doesn't work in 2BA9: debug

- fmode=3!! bplmod, ddfstop, pal copperlist & scroll table



- cli/sei: interruptions not enabled
- better bank switching if too frequent
