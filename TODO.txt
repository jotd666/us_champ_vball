- converter: if SBC_IMM	0x00 found later, don't optimize sbc into sub!
- flashing sprites (no dblbuf) but dblbuf crashes!!
- sprites not found after scrolling goes left, but logging reveals nothing; debug red color write!
  
- reduce global colors, reduce tile colors
- more accurate irq period (do irqs after pal wait if possible, at least 1 should be possible!)

- convert_graphics: separate tile/sprite files but computed together, separate palette file
- convert_graphics: group horizontally if possible for better performance, maybe using
  hardware sprites would be possible for players?
- graphics: black color should be converted too!

- create one gfx set per level/context like Dragonninja based on palette setup
  hopefully it's enough


- implement scrollx with OCS setup ATM (scroll table = 16): doesn't work
- DB16: write blank char doesn't work in 2BA9: debug: comes and goes, super annoying

- fmode=3!! bplmod, ddfstop, pal copperlist & scroll table



- cli/sei: interruptions not enabled
- better bank switching if too frequent

debug bankswitch change on MAME (22D is the copy in readable memory):
doesn't work as 22D is sometimes updated BEFORE bankswitch
